Worked on this project with my son Bobby (9 years old). We had lots of fun together.

### Components
* DCcEle DCcduino Uno
* Motor control shield for Arduino. 
We used two different alternatives: First tried with L293D. It worked fine with a LiPo battery 3S 11.1V. Then we tried connecting two LiPos consequitevely. It went ugly. After driving forward and backword for about 5 mins one of the L293D chips started smoking and even melted its socket. It felt like it will burst into flames if I wasn't fast enough to detach the battery. Then the quickest way to find another motor shield was to go to Maplin - this is where I bought the N06DH one from.
* Bluetooth controller for arduino (BC417)
* Tank chassis with two motors (24 V)

### Software 
* Arduino IDE
* Source code to install onDCcEle DCcduino Uno
* Any Android application for Smart Car Bluetooth Remote Controller

### Notes
* In Arduino IDE use board: Arduino/Genuino Uno - DCcEle DCcduino Uno works fine with it.
