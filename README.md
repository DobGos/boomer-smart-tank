Worked on this project with my son Bobby (9 years old). We had lots of fun together.

### Components
* DCcEle DCcduino Uno
* Motor control shield for arduino (L293D Driver)
* Bluetooth controller for arduino (BC417)
* Tank chassis with two motors (24 V)

### Software 
* Arduino IDE
* Source code to install onDCcEle DCcduino Uno


### Notes
* In Arduino IDE use board: Arduino/Genuino Uno - DCcEle DCcduino Uno works fine with it.
